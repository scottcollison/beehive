An assignment of this very project from a 200-level CS class: http://webs.wofford.edu/sloanjd/Spring16/CS235/Spelling.pdf

I did this project to plan and complete a basic data analysis task in python. Possible extensions of this toy include creating novel puzzles, suggesting one word at a time as hints, and building a web-facing app that looks pretty.
